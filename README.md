# Future-Intelligence

The idea of future intelligence is completely based on critical thinking and problem solving in which this solves the problem of many frauds and scams in the real estate department of DHA. where it has a lot of dublication and fabrication of the property documents in the vicinity.

In which if someone lives abroad and has rent out his/her property. the tenants capture the property even after giving several notices the tenants don't leave the house and in some cases threathen the landlord to keep the price same and let them live in the property.

So in result, I came with an idea to solve this problem using the newly introduced technology blockchain. where the technology focuses on keeping the <i> Node </i> secure and any other modification done or inteference in the chain of nodes. a permission will be required from every other node to verify the modification and if denied. the hashing address of all the nodes will be changed instantly.

The cryptographic hashing Algorithm is a kind of signature for a text or a data file. SHA-256 generates unique 256-bit signature for a text.

The use of SHA-256 Algorithm is used for the keeping the hashing of the nodes

The data structure involved is Linkedlist to place a single value of the document in a single node.

In order to run the program all have to do is download and extract it to your desired folder.
open terminal in the folder.

type: 

```g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp sha256.cpp Block.cpp -o joke
